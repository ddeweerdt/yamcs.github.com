title: Yamcs Client Tools Guide

<p>
  In the early days when Yamcs was strictly server software, several standalone GUI tools were developed that are still in use in some projects. This guide documents their main features. For new projects we recommend to use either the Yamcs web interface or Yamcs Studio.
