> _We are in the process of migrating and bundling our documentation from various sources that were built up in the past. Until this migration is finished, documentation on here may feel somewhat lacking._

**Yamcs Server**, or 'Yamcs' is the central piece of any deployment. Yamcs is responsible for acquiring, processing and dispatching data to clients via different protocols.

**Yamcs Studio** is a rich desktop client for use with Yamcs, the server. In its default configuration, it includes support for authoring and running operator displays, and comes bundled with various built-in displays that highlight different aspects of Yamcs (Alarms, Events, Commanding, Archive playbacks, etc.).
