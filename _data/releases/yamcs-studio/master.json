    "body": "* New\r\n  * The looks of the Event Log can be changed using custom rules\r\n  * An OPI file can be marked as the active 'schema'. Properties of this schema's widgets become defaults while editing other displays.\r\n  * Named OPI fonts/colors are now stored to user preferences. The initial list of named colors is less opinionated. Liberation Sans is the new default font.\r\n  * Yamcs Studio no longer auto-creates an example project. Instead examples can be manually added to your workspace via `File > New > Example...`\r\n  * Replay options have been extended to support range limiting, step-by-step replay and arbitrary speed factors.\r\n  * Application logs are now automatically persisted to `~/.config/yamcs-studio/logs` (rotated)\r\n  * Column changes in Command History and Event Log are saved to user preferences.\r\n  * When opening Yamcs Studio, the last used workspace is reopened.\r\n  * The Links view now indicates IN and OUT data counters in different columns, as introduced in Yamcs v4.7.\r\n\r\n* Bug fixes\r\n  * Fix importPackage support in Action scripts\r\n",
