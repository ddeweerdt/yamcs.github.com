<p>
  Yamcs Studio is a rich desktop client for use with Yamcs, the server. In its default configuration, it includes support for authoring and running operator displays, and comes bundled with various built-in displays that highlight different aspects of Yamcs (Alarms, Events, Commanding, Archive playbacks, etc.).

  Please note that this user guide only documents the functionality of our default open-source Yamcs Studio product. These instructions may vary depending on the way Yamcs and Yamcs studio were deployed at your site.
