In case you need to debug an issue with a deployed Yamcs Studio client, it can be useful to capture the logging output. Instructions are specific to the platform.

#### Linux

Launch the <tt>Yamcs Studio</tt> executable from a terminal window while redirecting all output to a file named <tt>log.txt</tt>

    ./Yamcs\ Studio >log.txt 2>&1


#### Mac OS X

With Terminal navigate into the Yamcs Studio application bundle and launch <tt>./Yamcs Studio</tt> directly
from there while redirecting all output to a file named <tt>log.txt</tt>. For example:

    cd Yamcs\ Studio.app/Contents/MacOS
    ./Yamcs\ Studio >log.txt 2>&1

#### Windows

With Command Prompt navigate into the location where you installed Yamcs Studio and launch <tt>Yamcs Studio.exe</tt> while redirecting all output to a file named <tt>log.txt</tt>. For example:

    "Yamcs Studio.exe" >log.txt 2>&1
