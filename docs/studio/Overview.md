### Yamcs Studio
Yamcs Studio is a desktop frontend to Yamcs. The main attraction is its support for synoptic operator displays, but it also includes other facets that cover manual TC commanding and insight into various runtime aspects of Yamcs.

Yamcs can be integrated within a display software other than Yamcs Studio (and in fact, this is often the case in long-running missions where Yamcs was added in the mix after the project's initial conception), but there are advantages to working with Yamcs Studio:

* Increased semantical coherence
* Single point of contact
* Opportunities for customisation that covers both server and client
* Integrated operational views

### License
Yamcs Studio follows a similar licensing scheme as Yamcs Server. The core of Yamcs Studio is open-source and licensed under the Eclipse Public License. Mission-specific extensions can be developed on a case-by-case basis and under custom licenses.

We believe that having an open-source core, is not only fun and exciting, but that this increases the quality of our products and benefits all of our customers equally.
