The `alarms` resource type within the WebSocket API allows subscribing to alarm updates.

We recommend using the LGPL Java WebSocket client distributed as part of the yamcs-api jar, but if that is not an option, this is the protocol:

### Subscribe to Alarm Notices
Within the WebSocket request envelope use these values:
* request-type `alarms`
* request `subscribe`

This will make your web socket connection receive updates of the type `ProtoDataType.ALARM`.

Directly after you subscribe, you will also get the active set of alarms -- if any.

Here's example output in JSON (with Protobuf, there's an applicable getter in the `WebSocketSubscriptionData`). Notice how we are first getting an `ALARM` of type `1` (`ACTIVE`) that triggered somewhere before we connected, and only then a further update on that alarm of type `4` (`PVAL_UPDATED`) (because the parameter value was updated).

### Unsubscribe
Within the WebSocket request envelope use these values:
* request-type `alarms`
* request `unsubscribe`

This will stop your WebSocket connection from getting further alarm updates.
