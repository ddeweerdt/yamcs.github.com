Records parameters. This service stores the data coming from one or more streams into a table <tt>pp</tt>. The term *pp* stands for processed parameter. These are parameters that typically are processed by an external system before being recorded in Yamcs. It is also used to store system parameters that are generated by Yamcs itself.

<div class="hint">
  Parameters extracted from packets are usually not stored in <tt>pp</tt>. Instead Yamcs provides a different service called the [Parameter Archive](/docs/server/Parameter_Archive_Service) which is specially optimized for data retrieval.

### Class Name
[<tt>org.yamcs.archive.ParameterRecorder</tt>](https://www.yamcs.org/yamcs/javadoc/org/yamcs/archive/ParameterRecorder.html)

### Configuration

This service is defined in <tt>etc/yamcs.(instance).yaml</tt>. Example from a typical deployment:

<pre class="r header">yamcs.simulator.yaml</pre>
```yaml
services:
  - class: org.yamcs.archive.ParameterRecorder

streamConfig:
  param:
    - pp_realtime
    - sys_param
```

With this configuration both system parameters and processed parameters coming from the <tt>pp_realtime</tt> stream are stored into the table <tt>pp</tt>.
