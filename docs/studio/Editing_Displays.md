The OPI Editor perspective is used to create or edit displays. In the top right, change your copy of Yamcs Studio to OPI Editor mode (in case you don't see it, choose it from the dialog that opens up when clicking the plus-icon).

![OPI Editor Perspective](/assets/yss-opi-editor-perspective.png){: .center-image }

Your window arrangement changes to something like this.

![OPI Editor](/assets/opi-editor.png){: .center-image }

In the left navigator, expand the YSS project and open for example our <tt>FlightData.opi</tt> by right-clicking and choosing **Open With > OPI Editor**.

**Note:** we are aware that right-clicking it is slightly annoying. The left-click action by default opens the OPI file with OPI Runtime. Once you've successfully opened an OPI with the OPI Editor the left-click action will from that point always open it with the OPI Editor, as it remembers its last handler. We definitely want to improve the user experience here. But for now, please bear with us as we do the needed development work.

The window layout can be decomposed like this:

![Edit FlightData.opi](/assets/yss-opi-editor-flight-data-annotated.png){: .center-image }

1. Navigator
    The [Navigator](/docs/studio/Navigator/) contains all projects within the current workspace. In general a project is at the same level as a mission, but this is not strictly necessary. When we launch Yamcs Studio with a new workspace, it will always automatically create the YSS project. Once you have added your own project, you can remove YSS and it won't be auto created anymore.
    
    A project contains Operator Displays (<tt>*.opi</tt>), images, style definitions (<tt>*.def</tt>), custom scripts (<tt>*.js</tt> or <tt>*.py</tt>), etc. Familiarise yourself with the right-click option as you go about opening displays. Displays can be opened in a few different modes within the OPI Editor.
    
    * In editing mode
    * In runtime mode in a Standalone window (*beta*)
    * In runtime mode within the workbench itself (this will split your window to make room for it)
    * In a new window using the green launch button in the toolbar
    
       
        It is useful to have all these options when you're in the process of editing and testing displays with realtime telemetry, but do pay attention to treat the OPI Editor like an editor, not like a runtime viewer. During operations you should switch back to the OPI Runtime.

2. Editor Area
    The [Editor Area](/docs/studio/Editor_Area/) contains tabs for every OPI that was opened for editing. This offers familiar editing controls. Widgets can be selected, grouped, dragged and deleted to your personal taste.

3. Outline
    The [Outline](/docs/studio/Outline/) view presents a hierarchical breakdown of all the widgets within the currently active editor tab. It is useful for finding back widgets. Widgets that were named will be easily identifiable. 

4. Toolbar
    The toolbar offers context-sensitive controls. This includes general *Save* functionality, as well as handy features like grid toggling or space distribution among different widgets.

5. Properties
    The [Properties](/docs/studio/Properties/) view shows the properties of widgets (or of the display itself). Notable properties include the **PV Name** which allows you to connect a widget with a specific Yamcs parameter (with autocompletion support). Other properties allow the display author to greatly tweak default widget behaviour. And in cases where the properties are not sufficient, we can always escape to more customization options using scripts and rules (there are properties for adding these as well). 

6. Palette
    The [Palette](/docs/studio/Palette/) contains the widgets that are available in your copy of Yamcs Studio. Select a widget from the Palette, and then click somewhere in the editor area to place it down.

When you are done doing changes, make sure to save them (**File > Save All**). You can now test out your changes by clicking the launch button ![Test Runtime](/assets/opi-editor-launch.png) from the toolbar.

This will open a new runtime window (notice it uses the OPI Runtime perspective). If you leave this window open, and you save more changes, do a right-click in your display tab and choose **Refresh OPI**. You will do this a lot as you go about editing displays. You can also refresh by hitting **F5**, but make sure that your display actually has focus (for example by clicking somewhere in the editor before hitting **F5**.
