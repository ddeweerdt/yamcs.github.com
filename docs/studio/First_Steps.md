#### Launching Yamcs Studio

When you launch Yamcs Studio for the first time it will ask you to choose a workspace. A **workspace** is where your resources are stored (e.g. a display file).

With Yamcs Studio, you are always working on one workspace at a time. Usually workspaces are fairly static, and you can often do with just one of them. If you untick the `Ask again?` option you will no longer see this message at startup.

![Select Workspace](/assets/studio/select-workspace.png){: .center-image }

Choose your preferred location, and click OK.

<p class="hint">
    If you unticked the `Ask again?`-option, but you want to switch workspace at a later moment, open <code>File > Switch Workspace...</code> from the window menu to choose a different directory.
</p>

#### Projects

Within a workspace we can have one or more **projects**, which provides a way to group similar resources together. For many missions, having just one project is more than enough.
