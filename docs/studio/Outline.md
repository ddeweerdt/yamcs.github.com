The Outline view, available from the Display Builder window, gives a hierarchical breakdown of the widgets contained in the currently active OPI. Some widgets are containers for other widget types, and will be shown as a node in the tree with a sub-node for every child.

Widgets can be named in the [Properties](/docs/studio/Properties/) view to make them stand out in the Outline.
