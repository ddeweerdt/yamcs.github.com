The Yamcs Clients view is a read-only view that shows you all the clients that are connected to the same Yamcs Server that you are connected to.

![Yamcs Clients](/assets/studio/yamcs-clients.png){: .center-image }

The displayed information includes:

<table class="inline">
    <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <td>The client ID assigned by Yamcs Server. Useful for debugging.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>User</th>
        <td>The name of the connected user, or <tt>unknown</tt> if Yamcs was not secured</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Application</th>
        <td>The name of the application that the user is using to connect to Yamcs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Instance</th>
        <td>The instance this user is connected to</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Processor</th>
        <td>The processor this user is connected to</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Note that our legacy standalone clients are not currently appearing in the list of connected clients. These clients connect using our previous API, and will be refactored towards the new API at some point.
