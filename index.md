In mission control centers, a major part of the ground segment is the front-end and back-end software which is used to assist payload and system operators in their daily tasks. Yamcs (short for *Yet another mission control system*) is a software package that positions itself as a lightweight alternative to traditional heavyweight Mission Control Systems.

Yamcs is a cost-efficient suite of tools for spacecraft, payload and ground segment operations preparation, execution and spacecraft AIT.

For development purposes, all the software can run on a developer's computer or laptop.

For more information on the Yamcs suite of tools, head over to the [Yamcs Docs](/docs/).
